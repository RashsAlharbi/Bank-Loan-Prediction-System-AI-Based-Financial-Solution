# About the Project
The project focuses on developing an intelligent model to identify deserving clients seeking loans. This challenge will be tackled using supervised learning techniques, specifically discrete classification. Two algorithms will be utilized: Decision Trees (DT) and Neural Networks (NN), to accurately classify potential loan applicants based on their profiles and behaviors.

This approach streamlines the loan approval process and enhances the bank's ability to serve its customers effectively.
